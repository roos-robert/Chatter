# Chatter

A realtime chat client based on Node.JS, Socket.io and MongoDB.

## Installation

1. Download the repo as a .zip
2. Unpack in your localhost directory
3. If needed, update the paths to MongoDB and Socket.io in server.js, chat.js and index.html

### Note

This is just a boilerplate template for a chat, much more work is needed- such as better validation etc.
